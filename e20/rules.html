						<h3>Rules</h3>
						<p>Though fencing has its roots in mortal combat, it has evolved into a sport that is regulated to ensure the safety and fairness of each bout.</p>
						<p>The techniques necessary to master fencing are vast and can be complicated, but the basic rules of fencing are actually relatively simple. Sparring bouts are typically very short and end when one opponent touches the other with his or her blade in a manner consistent with the fencing style being used. The steps taken to achieve the touch and to avoid being touched are up to the contestants, though certain techniques have proven most useful over the centuries. However, fencing is not an open-ended brawl, and the following restrictions must be observed by all contestants.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-xs-6">
								<h4>Finesse not Strength</h4>
								<p>Though a vital trait in historic duels, physical strength is less important in modern fencing. Sparring bouts can be ended with a mere touch of the blade, and contestants that regularly use excessive force in their attacks can be disqualified from competitions. Fencing has become battle of wits fought with a blade rather than a contest to injure an opponent. In fact, modern fencing is sometimes referred to as physical chess.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-xs-6">
								<h4>The Fencing Strip</h4>
								<p>Modern fencing is a linear contest, as all bouts are fought on a narrow strip, and contestants can lose a bout by stepping off of the strip. While more open footwork was an important part of historical fencing, the regulation of the fencing strip allows for a more controlled environment where the focus is on blade control rather than on combat.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-xs-6">
								<h4>Right of Attack</h4>
								<p>Right of attack is a common restriction in modern fencing. This, means that after a contestant's attack is parried (blocked) or dodged, that contestant cannot make another attack until he has parried or dodged an attack by his opponent. Though this may sound like it results in unentertaining bouts where contestants to "take turns" trying to hit one another, the actually effect is much less noticeable: the principle of right of attack is actually the natural flow of a duel, and it is typically followed even in unregulated bouts. The effective result of this regulation is simply that one contestant cannot beat an opponent into submission through rapid successive attacks.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-xs-6">
								<h4>Touch Regulation</h4>
								<p>Only touches made by designated parts of the sword are counted in scoring. Typically this means that only touches made by the tip of the blade count, but in Sabre fencing touches by the edge of the blade count as well. Hits by the pommel (base) of the sword never count in scoring and intentional blows by the pommel or hand guard can lead to disqualification.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-xs-6">
								<h4>Target Zones</h4>
								<p>Finally, in modern fencing, only certain regions of the body are considered viable targets (different styles of fencing have differently defined targets. See below for more details), and touches outside of those accepted regions are ignored in scoring.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-xs-12">
								<h3>Types of Fencing</h3>
								<p>There are three different styles of classical fencing: Foil, &Eacute;p&eacute;e, and Sabre. Though all of them follow the same basic rules of fencing, each has its own distinct focus based on the historical use of each weapon.</p>

											<p>Foil fencing is probably what most people think of when they imagine fencing. This fencing style is the most structured, and many fencing studios begin teaching students foil fencing before progressing to the more complex styles. Foil fencing is based on the historical use of smallswords (a.k.a. court swords) in duels. These duels were typically very structured with rules of honourable dueling, and the swords had very thin blades with only the tips of the swords being sharpened.</p>
											<p>Foil fencing uses right of attack, thus preventing one opponent from beating down another with rapid, successive blows. Foil fencing also limits the target area of each opponent to the torso. Furthermore only the tip of the blade is considered capable of delivering an attack, so only thrust touches count in scoring.</p>

											<p>&Eacute;p&eacute;e fencing is based on a slightly older era of fencing, when organized dueling rules were still being developed and sword duels were common. This was the time of rapiers, long, ornate swords whose primary method of attack was thrusting. While foil fencing is considered by many to be the ideal form of combat, &eacute;p&eacute;e fencing is considered to be one of the most complex.</p>
											<p>The entire body is a valid target in &eacute;p&eacute;e fencing, and this style does not use right of attack. This combination can lead to very fast sparring bouts. Though the essence of &eacute;p&eacute;e fencing is a more open, fluid style, the basic rules of fencing must still be observed, and only thrust touches count in scoring.</p>

											<p>Sabre fencing, as its name suggests, is based on the historical use of the saber. Though most commonly remembered for being wielded on horseback, the saber was also used for ground combat. Furthermore, most saber techniques are applicable to any sword of moderately length with a single sharpened edge.</p>
											<p>Sabre fencing is the only fencing style that allows cuts (touches by the edge of the blade) to count in scoring. Therefore, sabre bouts are more reminiscent of medieval combat than other fencing styles. However, right of attack is observed in sabre fencing, and only touches that land above the waist are counted. This latter rule is due both to this style's equestrian history and due to the prevalence of cautions against leg attacks in historical fight manuals.</p>
