Once conquered by Rome, the city was responsible for providing most of the grain to feed the Empire. In fact, briefly losing Carthage to the Visgoths was part of the reason for Rome’s decline. After captured from Rome by the Umayyad Caliphate, Carthage’s economic and political importance began to decline.
