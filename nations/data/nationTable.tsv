0	Jutes	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	24	<p>One of the most powerful Nordic tribes until they were conquered by the Danes, the Jutes were one of the first Teutonic cultures to establish a permanent settlement in Britain.</p>
1	Angles	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	12	<p>The tribe after which England was named, the Angles, with the help of the Saxons, conquered much of the British Isles and established several small kingdoms there. These and the Saxons were the ancestors of the Old English kings such as Alfred the Great.</p>
2	Frisians	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	24	<p>The primary ancestors of the Dutch, the Frisians did little expansion in their 800 year history, but managed to hold their own during the shifting tides of the Dark Ages until they were finally absorbed into the Frankish Empire.</p>
3	Franks	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	96	<p>One of the most influential Germanic tribes, the Franks created the first European Empire after Rome's decline. The Franks' history is one of conquest and expansion, and under the rule of Charlemagne, they created the first significant example of Western European Medieval culture. The Franks were the primary ancestors of the French and Germans.</p>
4	Saxons	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	48	A <p>powerful Germanic tribe known for their conquest of Britain with the help of the Angles, the Saxons were one of the most resilient Teutonic cultures. In addition to their success and significance in English history, the Saxons of mainland Europe retained their sovereignty for over 800 years, resisting Hun and Avar alike, until they were finally absorbed by Charlemagne's Frankish Empire.</p>
5	Lombards	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	48	<p>The primary ancestors of the Italians, the Lombards were a resourceful Germanic tribe that maintained their identity and bounced back after being conquered by the Huns. Later, they managed to escape conquest by the Avars by allying with them, and then slipping under the Alps to Italy before the Avars could change their mind.</p>
6	Burgundians	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	48	<p>The history of the Burgundians is interrupted by suzerainty. Though a successful tribe at the beginning of the Dark Ages, the Burgundians were crushed by the armies of Attila the Hun and ran to the Roman Empire for asylum. This arrangement lasted until Western Rome fell, when the nation enjoyed sovereignty once again. However, Charlemagne's Frankish Empire soon conquered them for good. The spirit of the Burgundians lives on today however in the French province of Burgundy.</p>
7	Thuringians	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	84	<p>A lesser-known Germanic tribe, the Thuringian's survived the Hun invasion to resurface and thrive until they were absorbed by the Frankish Empire.</p>
8	Alemanni	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	48	<p>One the bolder Germanic tribes, the Alemanni were a constant harassment to Rome before its demise. Though briefly conquered by the Huns, the Alemanni steadily grew their borders until they were conquered by the Franks.</p>
9	Marcomanni	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	24	<p>The Marcomanni were the one of the primary nations involved in the Marcomannic Wars against the Roman Empire. (They were possibly the barbarian tribe represented at the beginning of the movie <i>Gladiator</i>) Though they began their history in Eastern Europe, the Marcomanni joined with the Quadi, the Vandals, and the Alans to flee all the way to modern day Spain when the Huns began their conquest of Eastern Europe. The Marcomanni became one of the primary ancestors of the Spanish and Portuguese.</p>
10	Siling Vandals	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	24	<p>A small Germanic tribe that joined with the Asding Vandals during the beginning of the Hun invasion. The two were collectively known as the Vandals.</p>
11	Quadi	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	24	<p>A frequent ally of the Marcomanni, the Quadi fought alongside them in the Marcomannic wars against Rome. (They were possibly the barbarian tribe represented at the beginning of the movie <i>Gladiator</i>) Together, the two tribes were known as the Suevi. Later the Quadi joined the Marcomanni, the Vandals, and the Alans to flee from the Huns. The coalition eventually settled in Spain, where they became some of the primary ancestors of the Spanish peoples.</p>
12	Asding Vandals	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	36	<p>A small Germanic tribe that joined with the Siling Vandals during the beginning of the Hun invasion. The two were collectively known as the Vandals.</p>
13	Gepids	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	60	<p>A staunch Germanic tribe, the Gepids did not leave their territory (modern Romania) during the many Teutonic migrations of the early Dark Ages. The mountains and dense forests surrounding their land discouraged conquest, though they were briefly overrun by the Huns and they were frequently at war with the Lombards. Eventually it was an alliance between the Lombards and the Avars that ended their history.</p>
14	Rugians	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	108	<p>One of the many Germanic tribes during the early Dark Ages, The Rugians were frequent allies of the Huns (when they weren't being conquered by them). Their history as a distinct culture ended when they were defeated by the Italian king, Odoacer.</p>
15	Visgoths	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	84	<p>One of the most successful Germanic tribes, the Visigoths began their long history on the coast of the Black Sea were they periodically harassed Rome. However, when the Huns invaded Europe, the Gothic tribe fled to Rome for sanctuary. The Romans weren't very hospitable to their new refugees though, so soon after they arrived, the Goths revolted, crushing the Roman army in the Battle of Adrianople with the help of the Ostrogoths. Their king, Alaric, then led them on the beginning of a forty year migration all along the northern coast of the Mediterranean where the Visigoths ravaged the Empire, even sacking Rome itself. Eventually the Visigoths settled in Spain, where they became one of the primary ancestors of the Spanish. Their story ended when they were conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate.</p>
16	Ostrogoths	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	216	<p>One of the most successful Germanic tribes, the Ostrogoths created one of the first Germanic empires, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Their cavalry were second to none in the early European Dark Ages, and though they were overrun by the Huns, the nomadic horsemen respected the Goths' skill on horseback so much that the Ostrogoths would frequently ride with the Huns in raids. The Ostrogoth cavalry was a significant cause of the Gothic victory at the Battle of Adrianople, and it was the Ostrogothic King Theodoric that defeated King Odoacer to make the Ostrogoths one of only two Germanic nations to ever successfully claim Rome while the Roman Empire was still in power. Ironically, it was Emperor Justinian's re-expansion of Rome that ultimately ended the Ostrogoth's proud history.</p>
17	Danes	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	36	Germanic Tribe
18	Getes	teutonic	Pagan	0	1	36	<p>An early name for the Goths, the Getes were the tribe of the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths before the two nations crossed the Baltic Sea. Some of these Goths remain in their Scandinavian homeland though and continued as a distinct nation until they were conquered by the Swedes.</p>

25	Roman Empire	classical	Catholic	0	1	252	<p>Considered by many to be the greatest civilization of all time, for better and for worse, Rome made an enormous impact on Western Culture during its 2,200 year history. There are few who have not heard of the Roman Legions, whose discipline and structure was the basis for most modern militaries. Or of the atrocities of the gladiatorial games held in the Coliseum. Through force of conquest, Rome gave the West its alphabet and the basis for their modern languages, and Romeâ€™s infrastructure set an example for every nation that followed it.</p><p>While it begin as Pagan nation, Roman policy eventually became the primary cause for the popularity of Christianity in the West, a policy that empowered the Papacy and created the integration of church and state which dominated the Middle Ages. As part of this process, Rome blended the existing Pagan and Classical cultures into the Christian narrative to create the root culture of most of the Western World. </p><p>But for better or for worse, the empire eventually did come to an end. Not through a militant takeover, but through a 1,100 year atrophy where it failed to adequately adapt to the changing world around it. Through a long series of ill-advised bargains, betrayals, and raids Rome slowly crumbled from the Glory of the West, to a small empire that bore little resemblance to former days (The Byzantine Empire), to a single solitary city that refused to surrender (Constantinople), until finally that too fell. </p>
