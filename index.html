                            <p>Early vampire myths were rather varied and contradictory. Bram Stoker is often credited with cannonizing vampire lore with his famous work, Dracula, but this distinction should actually be shared with Sheridan Le Fanu. Le Fanu published his work of Gothic fiction, Carmilla, 26 years before Stoker published Dracula.</p>
                            <p>Carmilla tells the story of a female vampire that befriends her victims before draining their blood. Stoker pulled much of Dracula's lore from Carmilla, even (unintentionally?) copying themes of the story in his own work.</p>

                            <p>The terms valid and sound (e.g valid reasoning, sound logic) tend to get thrown around as if they are synonyms, but actually there is a distinct difference between the two when referring to logic and reasoning.</p>
                            <p>Valid simply means that no logical errors were made in an argument, while sound means that no logical errors were made and the starting assumptions are correct. So then, all sound logic is also valid, but not all valid logic is sound. Only sound logic is “correct.” As an example:</p>
                            <p>The argument, “Chicken tastes like strawberries; I added chicken to my soup; My soup will taste like strawberries,” is actually a perfectly valid argument since the logic behind it is good. However, we know that chicken does not taste like strawberries, so the premise of the argument is wrong, and the argument is not sound.</p>
                            <p>Sound, of course, is a relative term, because accepted starting assumptions may differ from circumstance to circumstance. So a practical, general definition for a sound argument is “an argument that follows valid logic based on starting assumptions that do not contradict one another.”</p>

                            <p>The Chinese culture is probably the most resilient culture that has ever existed. Throughout China’s 2,000 year history, its core culture has not changed, in spite of being conquered by foreign powers several times. Unlike most cultures, which blend with or become assimilated into the culture of their conquerors after a few generations, China would actually assimilate their conquerors into the Chinese culture. So the question is, Who conquered whom?</p>
                            <p>Their government may change hands, but the spirit of the Chinese people never dies.</p>

                            <p>Computer interaction is about to get a major overhaul thanks to two new technologies:</p>
                            <p>Leap Motion is a state-of-the-art gesture control system, meaning you can wave your hands about to interact with digital objects. The device is for sale now, but only a very limited number of applications support it so far.</p>
                            <p>Magic Leap is still under development, but should be released soon. It creates augmented reality (digital images overlaid on the real-world) by shining precise light beams directly into the eye, rather than projecting an image on glasses. This creates the impression the digital item actually exists in reality rather than seeing the image as a display on top of reality.</p>

                            <p>Most of us have either experienced or know someone that has experienced some form of dental anxiety. In fact, it has been said that up to 15% of adults are afraid to go to the dentist, a number reinforced by pop culture. As it turns out, there is a scientific explanation for this fear.</p>
                            <p>The active ingredient in the numbing shots given by dentist is epinephrine, otherwise known as adrenaline. Epinephrine is produced by the body as a fear response, triggering the fight or flight mechanism. One of the effects of epinephrine is blocking pain (If you’re being chased by wolves, it’s not the time to worry about your sprained ankle), but it also stimulates the regions of the brain that process emotion, instinct, and memory creation.</p>
                            <p>So from the moment you receive a shot at the dentist your body goes into a fear response (regardless of what you tell yourself about the situation) and your brain starts making detailed memories that are deeply connected to that visceral fear. Even if you don’t specifically remember being afraid (since you weren’t necessarily afraid at an intellectual level), your body still associates the event with fear at an instinctual level and presents emotions to discourage you from letting it happen again (Similar to how people tend to avoid foods that they ate right before contracting a stomach virus, whether the food poisoning was involved or not.)</p>

                            <h4>Friday Philosophical Musing:</h4>
                            <p>Parmenides’ Block Universe</p>
                            <p>In the 5th century BC, the philosopher Parmenides proposed that that all change was an illusion, that in reality everything was fixed: a single, solid block. Now on the face of it, this sounds totally preposterous, contradicting everything that we see and know. However, as crazy as it sounds, modern physics is beginning to point toward this philosophy.</p>
                            <p>Based on our current understanding, when Einstein’s Theory of Relativity is extrapolated out to its fullest, it necessitates the multidimensional universe that we discussed last week, a universe where time is merely another dimension, just as solid and tangible in higher dimensions as height and width are in our familiar three dimensions. If this is the case, then from the perspective of the higher dimensions our reality is a solid, unchanging, incredibly detailed block. Our past, present, and future are all simultaneously in existence when viewed from the higher perspectives, just as the top, middle, and bottom of a three dimensional object are simultaneously in existence from our perspective. Our perception is just moving through time toward a future that already exists.</p>
                            <p>Now here is where it gets sticky: If this is true, then what about free will and self-directed choice? If Parmenides and Einstein are correct, it would appear that we are just coasting along on a predetermined path with no say in how we live our lives. However, it is actually possible to have both a set future and a free will; it just all depends on your point of view. The best way to think of this is to think of a book.</p>
                            <p>A book is a solid fixed object, with a preset beginning, ending, and complex plot in the middle. Each part of the story exists simultaneously as the book sits on the shelf, and we can open the book to any page to see what is happening in the story at any time, in any order. Now, even though the entire story already exists from our perspective, we still recognize that from the characters’ perspective, the story’s time is very real, and that the characters have no knowledge of future events in their world. The characters are still making choices as their story unfolds; the fact that we know how the story is going to end in no way influences the characters’ free will or the choices they make in their world. We get a glimpse of this when we get totally immersed in a story (essentially putting ourselves in the characters’ dimension): When immersed, we never think that the characters are compelled by an outside force to think or act in a certain way, rather we live their story with them, sometimes even feeling suspense in spite of the fact that we already know how the story ends.</p>
                            <p>This is our existence. We are each characters in the story of our universe, whether that story has been authored by a higher being or come together through the laws of physics is another question entirely. We are but specks within the confines of our universe, and our universe is just one book in the vast library of the next dimension, and for all we know, that dimension is just one book in the library of yet a higher dimension.</p>
                            <p>Will we ever be able to fully comprehend this? Will we ever be able to transcend this universe and experience a higher dimension? I don’t know, but I do know that the full extent of reality is utterly awe-inspiring.</p>

                            <p>The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki may have been the result of the worst translation mistake in history. To understand why, we need to cover a bit of pre-WWII Japanese culture:</p>
                            <p>Japan’s military had a proud history. Until WWII, no foreign power had ever successfully invaded Japan for its entire 1,500 year history. This led to an arrogant spirit in their military ranks: defeat was not an option; suicide was preferred over surrender. Furthermore, for most of Japan’s history, the government was controlled by the military, and the emperor was merely a puppet ruler. It was only in the mid 1800’s that power began to shift back to the imperial courts. This was a slow process, and by WWII the Japanese government still had to act tactfully in its dealings with the military.</p>
                            <p>When the Potsdam Ultimatum was made, giving Japan the option of surrender or destruction, this would not have been an easy decision for the Japanese government. The US had gained the upper hand in the Pacific, so the threat was viable, but surrender would not be an option for most of Japan’s military, and a civil war was highly likely if the Japanese government accepted the USA’s terms. Japan’s official response to the States was silence, and their response to the Japanese people was that Japan was treating the ultimatum with mokusatsu, and reminding them that the only alternative to surrender was to continue fighting.</p>
                            <p>This is where things get sketchy. Mokusatsu is a rather ambiguous word: to treat something with mokusatsu could either mean that you were ignoring it or that you felt contempt for it. While it is certainly possible that the Japanese government was legitimately ignoring the ultimatum, it is possible that they were publicly expressing their contempt for the order while quietly trying to convince their military that surrender was their best option (Japan asserts that this was the case). If the latter was correct it would make sense that the government would choose a word that the military and general public could choose translate as statement of defiance, while still leaving a backdoor for them to surrender gracefully. (i.e. Something like: “Oh no, we never meant that we were ignoring it. The situation certainly breeds contempt, but we knew all along that we had no choice but to surrender.”)</p>
                            <p>Whatever was going on behind closed doors in Japan’s government, the Japanese media translated the statement with a nationalistic spin in their international English newspaper, claiming that Japan was ignoring the ultimatum and that they would continue fighting. When the US received no official response from Japan, they looked to the Japanese this media to gauge the atmosphere of the nation. The staunch claims of the newspaper were unintentionally made even more militant when US took “ignore” to mean “reject.”</p>
                            <p>We’ll likely never know for sure what truly happened, and there are valid arguments both for and against the necessity of the bombings. But if history shows us anything, it’s that nothing is ever as simple as it seems on the surface.</p>

                            <p>While sitting the trenches during WWI, J.R.R. Tolkien actually invented a complete language for the Elves in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, but he never got around to writing it all down. Now all that fans have to go by are fragments of the language gleaned from Elvish phrases and poems in the books themselves.</p>
                            <p>The language itself has Welsh and Norse influence, while inspiration for the written characters was draw from Sanskrit and Arabic. Furthermore, much of the Elvish lore has its roots in Norse and Celtic mythology.</p>

                            <p>The chivalric order of the Knights Templar is credited with creating the first modern banking system. The order was established during the time of the Crusades, and its primary purpose was to provide protection for Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. However, as they set up posts along the routes from Europe to Jerusalem an important secondary purpose developed.</p>
                            <p>All Templars swore an oath of poverty before being initiated into the order, so as European nobles acquired wealth in the Holy Land, they would frequently leave it under the Templars protection. (The same concept as having eunuchs oversee a harem). This eventually led to the Templars being in direct control of vast fortunes that they did not own themselves, fortunes that they would release it to their rightful owners on request.</p>
                            <p>The system grew in complexity as the problem of highway robbery increased. Nobles traveling to and from the Holy Land were prime targets for thieves, since the nobles would typically be traveling with large sums of money, either returning home with their conquests or setting forth with their capital. The Templars solved this problem by creating the precursor to wire transfers:</p>
                            <p>Before leaving for a journey a noble would deposit a large sum at the local Templar post in exchange for a personalized claim receipt. Once they arrived at their destination, they would visit a Templar post there and exchange their receipt for funds from the local vault.</p>

                            <h4>Friday Philosophical Musing:</h4>
                            <p>Eternalism</p>
                            <p>We are three dimensional beings that progress through a fourth dimension, time. The people we were ten years ago and the people we will be ten years from now are just as much us the people that we are now, but we are only able to be aware of ourselves (the rest of reality) is in the part of time that we call the present.</p>
                            <p>Now let’s go a step down and imagine a two dimensional universe where there is no tangible concept of height. The beings in this realm exist in width and depth and move through height like we move through time. As an example, imagine a tiny disk in this realm that steadily grows larger during its “life” until it reaches five inches across and then disappears. From our three dimensional perspective we would see this being as a cone. We could see and interact with any part of the cone; we could even touch multiple parts of the cone simultaneously, but as we changed the location of our fingers it would appear to the two dimensional being that we were interacting at different “times.” For instance, we could have a finger at the top and bottom of the cone at the same time, but to the two dimensional being it would appear that we were there at the beginning, then we would disappear as their perception moved through the gap between our fingers, then as their “time” passed and they reached the top, we would suddenly appear again.</p>
                            <p>If we could communicate with this world, it would be difficult to convey to them the concept of tangible height and likely impossible to make them understand time as we know it; even if they could grasp the concept, they would probably never fully understand it. Furthermore, we would probably state things that made no sense to them (Try explaining that the spiral running through their two dimensional universe was actually a single, connected shape rather than a series of disconnected ovals). And to top it all off, we could tell them about their “future,” the heights that they had not yet perceived. In short, we would appear godlike to this realm.</p>
                            <p>Now imagine that we were able to ascend to a four dimensional realm where the concept of time was just as tangible as height, width, and depth. We could look down on three dimensional beings and see every detail of their lives at a glance while our lives moved through some unknown fifth dimension. We could exist entirely outside of the three dimensional reality, but still reach down and interact with it, though they would only be able to see a facet of our entirety.</p>
                            <p>If a being could exist at that level, they would appear to be godlike to our three dimensional minds. If any of the deities described in world religions exist, perhaps they are simply four dimensional beings.</p>
