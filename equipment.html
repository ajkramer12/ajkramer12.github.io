							<h3>Equipment</h3>
							<p>Throughout the history of fencing protection from the opponent's blade has been important. This protection has evolved from the metal armour and chain mail in medieval times to flowing silk tunics in the Renaissance meant to catch an opponent's blade in its folds, and continues today with fencing uniforms and weapons designed to minimize risk of injury. The result is that, in spite of its brutal beginnings, fencing has become one of the safest sports in existence.</p>

									<h4>Masks</h4>
									<p>Though in the Renaissance, bulky helmets were abandoned in favour of greater visibility and mobility, the modern fencing mask has bridged the gap by offering head protection with minimal restrictions. The standard fencing mask consists of a thick wire mesh covering the front of the face, a metal and plastic shell around the sides and top of the head, and cloth and foam padding inside of the mask. The masks also have a bib made of stiff cloth to protect the neck. Because modern fencing requires opponents to always face one another there is no need for protection for the back of the head. The wire mesh offers exceptional visibility and is strong enough that it is impossible for approved fencing blades to bend or puncture it. For advanced fencers that require even greater visibility, Plexiglass mask have also been developed.</p>

									</figure>
									<h4>Jackets</h4>
									<p>Fencing jackets are made of thick cotton or nylon to protect from the impact of the blade while allowing full mobility. (Even in medieval times, thick cloth gambesons were commonly used as protection against swords) The result is protection from scratches or minor cuts that could be inflicted by the flexible blade, though an occasional bruise may occur if a bout gets intense</p>

									<h4>Plastrons</h4>
									<p>The plastron is an additional cloth piece to protect the underarm of the sword hand, were most touches occur. This extra layer of protection further helps decrease potential bruises.</p>

									</figure>
									<h4>Gloves</h4>
									<p>The sword hand of a fencer can receive hard knocks from his opponent's blade or, more commonly, his opponent's sword guard. Therefore fencers wear a padded glove on their sword hand which extend a third of the way up there forearm. Gloves are typically not worn on the opposite hand, because proper fencing techniques call for the non-sword hand to be kept out of reach of the opponent's blade anyway. However, some competitors do choose to wear gloves on both hands.</p>

									<h4>Lam&eacute;s</h4>

									<h4>Knickers</h4>
									<p>Fencing knickers are made of cotton or nylon like the jackets and are worn over top of the fencer's street clothes. However, since the legs are typically not a target in fencing, fencing knickers are not as thick as the jackets, being primarily used to provide a consistent look to the uniform.</p>

									<h4>Shoes</h4>
									<p>Fencing shoes are essentially sneakers with a flat heel to allow for easier lunges and faster movement. However, they are not necessary for casual bouts; standard sneakers or running shoes are sufficient.</p>

								<h3>Swords</h3>
								<p>Modern fencing blades have come a long way from the swords of old. Though still made of high carbon steel like their predecessors, they are blunted, very light, and forged to be highly flexible. The result is a blade that is more comparable to a thick car antenna than to traditional sword. Additionally, in foil and &eacute;p&eacute;e fencing, where the tip of the blade is the only part used for touches, the hand grip has been redesigned to allow for a more ergonomic thrust. This redesigned grip is called the pistol grip. However, some fencers prefer the traditional French grip. Modern fencing swords do retain the pragmatic inclusion of a handguard, different for each of the types of sword used in fencing.</p>

									<p>The fencing foil is based on the historical courtsword or smallsword. Used primarally as a clothing assecory for men in the late Renassiance into the colonial period, the smallsword was exceptionally quick, and could still be a lethal weapon in self defence or in duels. The modern foil retains the small disk handguard meant to deflect thrusts directly in front of the hand.</p>

									<p>The &eacute;p&eacute;e is based on the rapier of the Renaissance. This was the weapon of Romeo and Tybalt, Cyrano de Bergerac, and the Three Musketeers. Used almost exclusively in duels, rapiers were much more ornate that their heavy predecessors. However, one of the most common rapier styles was the Spanish hilt rapier with a bell shaped guard meant to protect the whole hand. This is the handguard style that has evolved into the &eacute;p&eacute;e.</p>
